// Grades are computed using a weighted average. Suppose that the written test counts 70%,  lab exams 20% and assignments 10%.
// If Arun has a score of:

// Written test = 81
// Lab exams = 68
// Assignments = 92
// Arunâ€™s overall grade = (81x70)/100 + (68x20)/100 + (92x10)/100 = 79.5

// Write a program to find the grade of a student during his academic year.
