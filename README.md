## Features  

- **Practical Workouts**: A wide variety of exercises to practice TypeScript concepts.  
- **Compiled JavaScript**: Includes precompiled JavaScript files for quick execution.  
- **Roadmap for Guidance**: Structured roadmap to help users focus on essential concepts.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).  
- Install TypeScript globally:  
  ```bash  
  npm install -g typescript  
  ```  

### Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/typescript-workouts.git  
cd typescript-workouts  
```  

### Install Dependencies  
```bash  
npm install  
```  

### Compile TypeScript Files  
```bash  
tsc  
```  

### Run Exercises  
Use Node.js to execute the compiled JavaScript files in the `dist` folder:  
```bash  
node dist/add2DArray.js  
```  

Or, directly run TypeScript files using `ts-node` (if installed):  
```bash  
npx ts-node workouts/add2DArray.ts  
```  

## Usage  

1. **Workouts**: Explore the `workouts` folder for TypeScript exercises.  
2. **Compilation**: Use `tsc` to compile `.ts` files into `.js`.  
3. **Execution**: Run the compiled files from the `dist` folder or use `ts-node` for direct execution.
